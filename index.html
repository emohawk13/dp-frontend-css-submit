                <a href="">Mike Patey</a> was born in Gresham, Oregon, along with twin brother, Mark, right in the
                middle of 11
                children. He and his wife, Chandra, who is a pilot as well, have 4 children. His aviation journey
                began in a 1971 Cessna 172L in 2002. He subsequently earned his single/multi-engine land and sea,
                commercial, instrument, and rotorcraft ratings along with various endorsements. His natural energy
                and knack for engineering feed his love for the challenge to circumvent the norms and “build it
                better.” This drives his passion to create and build his own airplanes, which he uses for
                competitive racing, STOL, flying his family, business, and playing with his fellow “Flying Cowboys.”
                He holds several aviation records and enthusiastically shares his process and adventures via his

                Born in Gresham, Oregon, in 1972, Mark started life as a high-energy, curious child. Mark has built
                multiple successful companies, starting the first at the age of 15 and employing hundreds by the age
                of 21. Mark is an identical twin and lives in Spanish Fork, Utah, with his wife and four sons.
                <br><br>
                Mark and his family currently own and operate Best Tugs employing hundreds as they manufacture the
                best general aviation tugs on the market. If you`re in need of an aircraft tug, Best Tugs is the
                best out there. Past achievements have included building several other successful businesses, both
                large and small. He was the host of his own motorsports show on ESPN, and is consistently rated as
                one of the top presenters and trainers in the country.
                Mark enjoys collecting, building, and flying airplanes, and donates his time and personal helicopter
                to the Utah County Search and Rescue. In 2010, the state of Utah awarded Mark with The Citizen

            <p class="about">
                Jason Sneed was born in Pensacola, Florida. His love of flight began early, thanks to both of his
                grandfathers. One gave him his first taste in a v-tail Bonanza at the age of 18 months and as he
                grew older, he was able to work on his other grandfather`s full-sized MD F-4J Phantom II Blue Angel
                replica in his garage. By age 13, Jason had earned enough money cleaning yards to purchase a
                Commodore 64, which he used to practice proficiency in instrument flying. In 1999, he completed
                training in his Cessna 140 and has since acquired instrument and multi-engine commercial ratings.
                With 2 airplane builds under his belt, a Rans S7S, and a Carbon Cub, he is currently working on
                “Deception”, a 330 hp Carbon Cub. He is a member of the “Flying Cowboys” and has a profound passion
                for flying, which he shares with everyone he meets as well as on his YouTube channel, found under
                “Jason Sneed.”

            <p class="about">
                Kevin Quinn is a flying freak…seriously. It`s about all he thinks about, and how to do it SAFELY!
                Kevin is a former professional hockey player and played in the ECHL, WCHL, WHL with brief stints in
                the IHL and AHL. He retired in 1995 and started pursuing his aviation and ski life. Kevin allocates
                time between flying airplanes, running his heli-ski operation in Alaska (<a
                    href="https://www.alaskaheliski.com/" target="_blank">Points North 24 years</a>), and
                spending as much time in the ocean at his other home in Kauai, HI. Of course time with his family is
                the most important to him. Kevin has been flying since he was a kid with his father and relatives
                growing up in Alaska. Kevin has an FAA Commercial Flight Instructor (CFI) certificate with an
                instrument rating and currently has just under 9000 hours of total time, most in the off-airport
                environment. Additionally, he`s an EMT/ Wilderness medicine trainer, Avalanche Educator, and former
                President of U.S. Heli Ski Association (8 years) and is a Certified Heli-Ski Guide Trainer. He
                created the High Sierra Fly-in (11 years running now) and created STOL Drag, which is also the
                newest class of racing at Reno. He is a member of The Flying Cowboys and recently purchased a 1944
                Stearman. To say he is passionate about aviation would be an understatement.
                <br>
                Sharing his passions with others is something that he looks forward to daily. He will fly just about
                anything he can get his hands on: Airplane, Glider (sailplane) Paraglider, Powered Paragliger,
                Skydive, Speed Wing, you name it. He has been fortunate to fly a number of different aircraft
                including Helio Couriers, Super Cubs, Cessnas (152, 172, 170, 180, 182, 185, 206), Beaver, Maule,
                Highlander, Stretch SuperStol, and few Cirrus aircraft. His newest passion is Biplanes and the
                history that goes with them, recently being checked out in a Navy N3N biplane and then a Stearman.
                His passion really is landing bush planes above 9000' daily. He is an EAA Young Eagles Pilot with
                nearly 100 kids flown to dates, and that number changes almost weekly. Safety and training is his
                primary responsibility in life. As a father of two children (6&10) and married to his beautiful wife
                Jessica (together now over 20 years and she lets him fly with her full support), Kevin is set on
                safely accessing the backcountry and training others to do so as well. Making good pilots better is
                his mission.
                <br>
                His Instagram is @STOLPilot and he also runs several Facebook groups including Big Tire Backcountry
                Flier Page, STOL Pilot, and Points North Heli pages.

                Steve really enjoys competing in STOL Drag and STOL events while also flying the extreme
                backcountry. Steve started flying in 2003 in his hometown of Nampa, Idaho and built his first Just
                Aircraft Highlander in 2004, becoming dealers for them in 2010. Steve is constantly thinking up new
                ways he can make these already amazing planes perform even better. After making a YouTube video of a
                dead stick take off on one of the steep hills in his area, flying two miles and 1500 feet down to a
                river bed with no engine running, and landing, he got a lot of folk's attention. He flew his 2014
                Just Aircraft SuperSTOL to Valdez and finished third behind Frank Knapp and Josh Peppered. Steve
                also placed first at the STOL Competitions at Oshkosh in 2017 and 2018 and got a close second place
                at High Sierra in 2019. He won the High Sierra Fly-In STOL Drag in 2016 and had a very, very close
                second in 2017, as well as the second-best time next to DRACO in 2018. Needless to say, Steve is a
                tough competitor at STOL Drag! Steve also received the Charles Lindbergh Reserve Grand Champion
                Award at EAA AirVenture for Light Sport Plane in 2018 with Yee-Haw 6 and won it again in 2019 with
                Yee-Haw 7. Both planes have Yamaha engines with SkyTrax PSRU. Steve can`t say enough of the Edge
                Performance's EPeX Yamaha 300 HP engine in Yee-Haw 7, it`s truly a beast. Steve is always open to
                chatting about Highlanders, and if you ever have questions he`s happy to chat.

            <p class="about">
                Trent Palmer started his aviation career flying drones. When the FAA came out with new regulations
                in 2014, the change inspired Palmer to get his pilots license in order to comply with the new rules.
                Terrified of flying and heights, the opportunity was not something that excited Trent. However, by
                the time his training complete, he was already on the hunt for an airplane he could afford... and thus
                was born the Freedom Fox.Trent has enjoyed being involved in both STOL demonstrations at Oshkosh, as
                well as STOL Drag at Reno and High Sierra Fly-In, where he took 2nd place only to Draco.

            <p class="about">
                Creighton King loves flying and building airplanes. Born into an aviation lineage from the 1920`s,
                Creighton soloed on his 16th birthday and has been flying ever since. He has a fantastic bride
                Tonya, 2 teenage daughters, 2 dogs, and 3 airplanes. Creighton owns a 56 piper Tripacer he learned
                to fly in, a Cassutt Racer that he has improved through the years to gain nearly 50 mph in Reno, and
                an experimental Cub. His buddies lovingly called the cub Rusty, and it stuck. His Dad built it and
                Creighton helped finish it and that cub has continued to fly for 27 years until bending in a big
                cross wind crash on a beach. Creighton is currently rebuilding “Rusty” and making it even better.
                Rusty was flying before the other Cowboys and may have a bit of rust, but after the rebuild it
                should fly very well. Creighton is pretty good at TIG Welding as well as building light weight
                carbon parts. He likes to cover with Stits fabric and paint with a Harbor Freight paint gun. He is
                also the inventor of <a href="http://www.griplockties.com/" target="_blank">www.GripLockTies.com</a>;
                Releasable Rubber-Lined Zip Ties. He spends his days
                working to build the company and help eliminate crappy zip ties from the planet.

            <p class="about">
                Hal lives in the desert of Elko, NV. In April of 2020 after working 45 years on large mining and
                construction equipment, Hal finally decided to retire and now devotes his time solely to aviation
                and his love for Rotax engines. Hal`s love for aviation spans decades. In 1995, he and his
                brother-in-law built an ultralight, and was the first time Hal discovered experimental aircraft. In
                1999, Hal bought his first Rans S-7, which he enjoyed tinkering with to pull more and more power out
                of. In 2010 he started working with Rotax engines, which he also modified and altered to produce
                even more power. With his latest project, Lawn Mower 3, Hal enjoys competing in STOL competitions,
                and having that extra power on such a light aircraft makes a huge difference. Flying and working on
                little airplanes is all Hal wants to do with his retirement time, and he`s having a blast. He has
                over 4000 hours in Ran S-7 airplanes alone, and hopes to get many more.
