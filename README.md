Assignment - Webpage Replication 3


Now that we better understand the box model, display and layout we are ready to try replicating a harder layout. In this replication we will recreate the login page below.

Include the following in your replication:

Create a navigation bar

Include a hero image that takes up the left half of the page

The login form should:
Be on the right side of the page
Be centered in the white space
Submit to https://httpbin.org/post and should echo back
Include a:
Large header
Email field (required field)
Password field (required field)
Submit Button
Style the form elements

Additional Stylings:

Import at least 1 (one) font from google fonts
Have a default font for the whole page
Change the default font to a different font for your login header
Style the form elements (the best you can)
